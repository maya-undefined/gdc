# gpu-desktop-calculator

need to add two columns of numbers an exabyte in size from the cli?

definite work-in-progress. I eventually want to do more complex calculations you might find in AI

## usage

	./gpu f1.dat f2.dat out.dat

Files should be organized in columns of numbers. The code will add across (axis=0). Multiple columns of data per file are forthcoming.

## data

Test data can be generated by `datagen.sh`. These will create 1.6 GB of test data.

	cpu 		75.9				  67.3
	gpu 		61.7				  61.8

	implementation vs average time in seconds for generated data
